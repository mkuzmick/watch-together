# Getting started with a Slack App
1. Navigate back to Atom. In watch-together, make a new file in the `routes` folder by duplicating `index.js`. You can call the new file `slack.js`.
2. In the code of the file, change `index` to `slack` and change the value of `title` from `Watch Together` to `Slack Tests Go Here`.
