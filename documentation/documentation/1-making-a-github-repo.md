# Making a Github Repo

1. Go to your github profile ([https://github.com/*YOUR-USERNAME*] in your internet browser, and click on "Repositories". Then click on the green button that says "New" to create a new repository. 

2. Write a name for your repository that is simple and clear. Do not use spaces, instead use "-". For example, "watch-together".

3. Write a description for your repository. This step is optional. In this case, we will write, "An express app that will connect airtable, slack, and some film database API."

4. Check the box to initialize this repository with a README. **what does this mean, do we want an explanation here?**

5. Click the "Add .gitignore: none" button and type in and then select "node".
