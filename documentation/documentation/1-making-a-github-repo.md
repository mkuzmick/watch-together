# Making a Github Repo

1. Go to your github profile ([https://github.com/*YOUR-USERNAME*] in your internet browser, and click on "Repositories". Then click on the green button that says "New" to create a new repository. 
2. Write a name for your repository that is simple and clear. Do not use spaces, instead use "-". For example, "watch-together".
