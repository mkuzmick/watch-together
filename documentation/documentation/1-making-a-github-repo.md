# Making a Github Repo

1. Go to your github profile ([https://github.com/*YOUR-USERNAME*] in your internet browser, and click on "Repositories". Then click on the green button that says "New" to create a new repository. 

2. Write a name for your repository that is simple and clear. Do not use spaces, instead use "-". For example, "watch-together".

3. Write a description for your repository. This step is optional. In this case, we will write, "An express app that will connect airtable, slack, and some film database API."

4. Check the box to initialize this repository with a README. **what does this mean, do we want an explanation here?**

5. Click the "Add .gitignore: none" button to type in, and then select, "node".

6. Click the "Add a license" button and select "MIT License". **marlon, during your screencast you said this doesn't really matter. do we want this step in here?**

7. Click "Create repository".

8. Now, click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the URL by clicking the clipboard icon next to the URL.

9. Open up your computer's terminal.
 
10. In Terminal, open up the folder you *do your development in* **(how to phrase this?)**. The terminal command for this is "cd Development(or whatever you have called your folder)".

11. First making sure you are now making changes in the development folder you tried to open, next type in "git clone INSERT-URL-YOU-COPIED" and hit enter.
