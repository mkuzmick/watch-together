# Getting Started with Heroku
**should we say what heroku is?**

1. First, sign up for a username on [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/). For the question about primary development language, select "Node.js".
2. Next, type `heroku install homebrew` into Google and click on the first link, which should be [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). Copy the code  (`
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
`).
3. Before pasting the code into terminal, make sure you are not in the watch-together folder, but just the computer's name and if applicable, your username. You may need to open a new terminal tab. Then, paste the above code into terminal and hit enter.
4. Navigate back to your watch-together folder in terminal and type in `heroku create ll-watchtogether`. You will then get a message in terminal that says `heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:`. Press any key so you can confirm your heroku login. 
5. You will then likely get a message that the name you chose (ll-watchtogether) is already taken. Continue to type in `heroku create NAME` until you find a name that is not taken.
