1. had this question at doc 3, step 4 - why don't I copy the `$`?

2. whenever you run the `npm install` command, you need to be in the root folder of your app, the folder with the `package.json` file. This is because `npm install` is going to look in the current folder for `/node_modules` and put the package there.
